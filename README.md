The official Python SDK for [Textfully](https://textfully.dev) â€” The Open Source Twilio Alternative.

## Installation

```bash
pip install textfully
```

## Setup

First, you need to generate an API key from the [Textfully Dashboard](https://textfully.dev/dashboard/api/keys).

## Quick Start

```python
import textfully

# Set your API key
textfully.api_key = "tx_apikey"

# Send a message
textfully.send(
    "+16178856037", # verified phone number
    "Hello, world!"
)
```

Check out example implementations in the [examples](https://github.com/textfully/textfully-python/tree/main/examples) directory.
